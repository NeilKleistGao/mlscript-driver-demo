# MLscript Driver Demo
## Quick Start
MLscript uses `git` to track file changes. Please use `git clone` rather than download the project.

To install the necessary libraries, execute:
```shell
npm i
```

To watch the project, execute:
```shell
npm run watch
```

You need to compile TypeScript manually:
```shell
tsc
```

To execute the final program, run:
```
node js/mlscript/Main.js
```
